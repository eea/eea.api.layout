Secret Scanning
===============

This repository uses the Betterleaks GitHub Action to scan the current
repository content on every push and pull request. The scan uses the rules in
``.gitleaks.toml`` and uploads a ``betterleaks-report`` artifact when a finding
is detected.

If the optional SMTP secrets are configured, failed scans also send an email to
the last commit committer. The workflow expects these repository or
organization secrets:

- ``SMTP_URL``
- ``SMTP_PORT`` (optional, defaults to ``25``)
- ``SMTP_EMAIL``
- ``SMTP_PASSWORD`` (optional if the SMTP server does not require authentication)

Port ``465`` is sent with direct TLS; other ports use the default SMTP
handshake. The email includes a short finding summary from the redacted
Betterleaks report, including the redacted matched line from each finding.

There are three common outcomes:

1. Everything is OK. The ``Betterleaks / Scan for secrets`` check is green and
   no action is needed. Regular references to runtime values are OK, for example::

     token_from_cookie = request.cookies.get("auth_token")

2. A real secret was found. The check is red and the workflow log asks you to
   download the ``betterleaks-report`` artifact. Open the artifact from the
   GitHub Actions run and check the reported file, line and rule. Remove the
   committed value, move it to the proper secret store, and rotate it if it was
   exposed. A report entry looks like this::

     {
       "RuleID": "secret-literal-assignment",
       "File": "src/config.py",
       "StartLine": 12,
       "Secret": "[REDACTED]"
     }

3. The finding is a false positive. Keep the value only if it is clearly not
   sensitive, such as a test fixture, placeholder, or public example. Add
   ``betterleaks:allow`` on the same line and include a short explanation in the
   pull request::

     test_password = "admin"  #betterleaks:allow

Do not add ``betterleaks:allow`` to real credentials.
